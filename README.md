RETRO
How did you feel?
Kelly: Excited. Nice to be writing code, learning new syntax
Jacqueline: Felt like we got some good movement
Diana: Unusual combination of feelings: not knowing what the language is 
        doing, but no frozen fear
Carl: Happy we completed the rules, with confidence.  Also liked 3min rotation 
      better than two

What did you learn?

What did you observe?
Jacqueline: Safe space: not afraid to say when not understanding.
Diana: When I didn't understand, I didn't feel judged.

What went well?
Kelly: bite-sized pieces, step-by-step, up-front, go faster.  Iterative nature.
Call: I got called out on not listening to the talker.  "I see you typing..."
